# Outstanding work

What a complete adapter would have, sized and reasoned, so that the next session picks up an argument
rather than a list.

**Sizes.** *Small* is a translator case and a test. *Medium* is a node, a rule, or an SDK surface.
*Large* needs a design decision recorded in `DESIGN.md` before any code.

**On finishing.** When an item is done, remove it — the entry, its rationale, and any *done* marker
elsewhere in this file. This file holds only work still to be done; what was decided belongs in
`DESIGN.md`, what was built is visible in the code and its tests, and history lives in git. A *done*
paragraph kept here is a second copy of one of those, aging independently.

**On testing a change.** Before believing a test covers what it claims, check that it *fails without
the change*. This has repeatedly told both stories: fixes whose tests genuinely depended on them, and
guards that turned out to be dead code — the case they guarded already unreachable. Neither is
visible from a green suite.

**On evidence.** Where a claim about the service is unverified it says so. The emulator has disagreed
with Azure in both directions — accepting an `ORDER BY` over an unnest alias that Azure rejects, and
rejecting the full text search Azure runs — so "the reference says" is not a measurement. Point
`COSMOS_TEST_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_TEST_KEY` at a real account and the suite runs against one.

---

## 0. Resuming

**587 tests: 581 passing, 6 skipped**, on net8.0 and net10.0, against Apache.Calcite 2.0.0-pre.7.
The skips are things only a real account can answer; the suite runs against one when
`COSMOS_TEST_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_TEST_KEY` name it, and reports inconclusive rather than passing
where the emulator cannot — and each of them detects the gap it is skipping for, so an environment
that closes one asserts rather than going quiet. Several facts in this file and in `DESIGN.md` were
settled by measurement, each time with an Azure account, used and deleted.

No PRs are open and nothing is parked; `main` is where the work is and a new branch starts from it.

Reading, writing (`INSERT`, `DELETE` including the whole-partition form, and `UPDATE` of the map
column as a whole-document replace), the lookup join, partial aggregates, `DISTINCT`, the scalar
functions and the diagnostics surface are complete and covered. What remains below is not started.

**Declared columns were built and then dropped**, and the shape of the hole they left is worth
knowing before anyone rebuilds them. A caller-declared, typed document path promoted to a real
column — through a `columns` operand — would have given three things a type to work with: a
patchable `UPDATE` target, an argument the nullable-aggregate rewrite could fire on, and a declared
temporal representation. Every one of those items below still names that dependency, because the
dependency is real; what is gone is one answer to it, not the question.

The fourth, **a sort key that can be non-nullable**, turned out not to need a declaration at all: a
query that removes the nulls itself settles the null placement, and the planner already carries
that fact. It is done for the promoted columns and out of reach inside the map column — and *why*
it is out of reach says more about the surface than the original argument did. See section 6.

### Running the sample

```
dotnet run --project samples/Apache.Cosmos.Sample/Apache.Cosmos.Sample.csproj
```

It needs the Cosmos emulator on `localhost:8081` and prints the docker command if it is missing. It
seeds both sources and is safe to re-run. What it demonstrates is the lookup join across two adapters:
the CSV side's three product ids are pushed into Cosmos, so the container is filtered at the service
rather than read whole.

### Integration requirements, recorded in the README

Three things trip a host and fail with messages that name nothing useful: the calc rules must run as
a *pass* after the planner (`Programs.CALC_PROGRAM`'s shape — given to Volcano they do nothing), a
model must name `CosmosSchemaFactory` assembly-qualified with the assembly already loaded, and
`defaultNullCollation` defaults to the opposite of the service's null placement, so every sort on a
document path silently declines until the connection says `LOW`. The README carries all three with
the reasoning.

### Where to start

1. **A metadata cache on the schema** (section 1) — the design is settled and the cost is real:
   every connection re-reads a container's definition, and any connection planning a
   whole-partition `DELETE` re-probes the account. One thing to verify before building it — whether
   `Apache.Calcite.Data` offers a supported way to hand back the same schema instance.
2. **An explicit statistics refresh** (section 1) — the time to live is in; what is missing is a way
   for a caller to say *now*, which after a bulk load is the only moment that matters.
3. **Typed columns, if they are wanted at all** (section 6) — three items name this dependency, and
   nothing satisfies it. Whether the answer is a `columns` operand, computed properties, or
   something else is open again, and the fourth item's departure sharpened the case rather than
   weakening it: read section 6's last paragraph first.

---

## 1. Statistics and the cost model

`getStatistic` reports keys from declared metadata and a row count read from the service; the cost
model is still inference over constants. Everything here is a read of something the service already
knows, or the model those reads deserve.

### Document size into the cost model — *small*

Average document size is already derived from the container's resource usage and not yet used. It is
what a row costs to move, which for a map row model carrying whole documents dominates.

### Provisioned throughput — *small*

`ReadThroughputAsync`. Not needed to compare two plans, but it is the denominator that turns an RU
estimate into a latency estimate, and it distinguishes a container that can absorb a scan from one
that cannot.

### Feeding `RequestCharge` back — *large*

The measured charge is on the `cosmos.request_charge` histogram and the `cosmos.query` span. A
measured charge for a query shape is worth more than the estimate that was used to choose it, but a
cost model that learns needs somewhere to keep what it learnt — the statistics-refresh question
below wearing a different hat.

### Per-partition skew — *not available; recorded so nobody looks again*

Per-partition storage is an Azure Monitor metric, not data plane. The count is reachable and the
distribution is not, so a hot-partition estimate would have to come from outside the adapter.

### Nothing is remembered between connections — *medium, and it now costs more than it did*

`CosmosSchemaFactory.create` runs per model read, which in the ADO.NET path is per *connection*, so
every connection builds fresh `CosmosContainerMetadata` and with it fresh lazy cells. Within a
connection each fact is computed once; across connections nothing is shared, though the client can
be. That was two round trips per container for statistics; the whole-partition delete capability
adds a third for any connection that plans one, and a short-lived-connection application pays them
all again each time.

**The cache hangs off the schema**, which is where the lookup cache already hangs and for the same
reason: no global static, no leak between accounts, and the lifetime is the caller's to choose. It
does not help a host that rebuilds its schema per connection — but that is the honest shape, because
the alternative is a process-wide cache keyed by `CosmosClient.Endpoint` that outlives every
decision anyone made about it. ADO.NET pushes callers to recreate connections freely and pool them
underneath; reusing the *schema* across those connections is the documented way to keep what it
learnt, and the README should say so beside the client-factory guidance.

Three facts, three lifetimes, and they are not the same:

- **The container definition** — partition key paths, indexing policy. Changes only by a control
  plane operation; cache for the life of the schema.
- **The whole-partition delete capability** — a property of the account, changed only by a support
  request. Same treatment.
- **Statistics** — genuinely mutable, and sharing them across connections is what makes
  *Statistics refresh* below load-bearing rather than theoretical: without a time to live, one
  connection's stale row count would outlive the connection that fetched it.

Worth verifying first: how a host reuses a schema through `Apache.Calcite.Data`, since the model
path builds one per connection and the guidance is only actionable if there is a supported way to
hand the same instance back.

### An explicit statistics refresh — *medium*

A row count now expires and is read again — five minutes by default, `statisticsExpireSeconds` to
say otherwise — so a long-lived schema no longer plans for ever against the first number it saw.
What a time to live cannot do is let a caller say *now*: after a bulk load, the useful moment to
re-read is the one the caller knows about and the clock does not. Drill's answer is a metastore that
an explicit `ANALYZE TABLE COMPUTE STATISTICS` populates, which decouples the fetch from the query
altogether and is the shape worth copying.

### Statistics after pushdown — *large*

Flink collects connector statistics *after* partition pruning and filter pushdown, so the number the
planner sees describes the scan it will actually do rather than the whole table. Here that would mean
a row count for a partition-pinned scan rather than for the container — which is the difference
between costing a single-partition read and costing everything. It needs a statistic attached to a
`RelNode` rather than to a table, which is a larger change than it sounds.

### A cost model in RU — *large*

The above are inputs; this is the model. Cosmos charges in RUs and the current model multiplies
Calcite's abstract cost by constants. A model in RUs — a point read is 1, a query is 2.3 plus scanned
size, a cross-partition query is that times the fan-out — would make pushdown decisions comparable
with in-process alternatives on a real scale rather than a notional one.

---

## 2. Execution paths

Queries execute through `GetItemQueryStreamIterator`, with a pinned `id` and complete partition key
recovered as a point read. The SDK's other cheap routes are unused.

### The sample against SQL Server — *small*

Apache.Calcite 2.0.0-pre.3 fixed the ADO.NET adapter against SQL Server
([calcite-dotnet#24](https://github.com/ikvmnet/calcite-dotnet/issues/24)), so the sample's CSV side
can become the SQL Server it was meant to be — a one-line change, plus the SQL Server the sample
would then need running beside the emulator, which is the actual decision. Nothing in CI runs the
sample either way; it was last verified by hand against pre.3.

### Change feed — *large*

`GetChangeFeedIterator` is a fundamentally different read: ordered by `_ts` within a partition,
resumable, and the basis of every incremental pipeline built on Cosmos. It is not a table in the
relational sense — it has no end — so exposing it means deciding what it *is* to Calcite: a table
function taking a start time, a streaming source, or something a caller drives and the adapter only
materializes.

### Continuation tokens — *medium*

A query's continuation token makes a result resumable, and the adapter reads every page eagerly within
one enumeration. `GROUP BY` and `DISTINCT` results are documented as not resumable, which is a
constraint on where this can apply rather than a reason not to.

---

## 3. Writing

Writes are item CRUD behind a `TableModify` — Cosmos SQL has no DML, and does not need to for the
adapter to write. What each statement does and refuses is recorded in `DESIGN.md` under *Writing*.

### `UPDATE`, the patch tier — *blocked on there being a typed column to target*

`SET "_MAP" = …` executes as a whole-document replace. What remains is the cheap tier: a targeted
`SET` of a plain document property as `PatchItemAsync`, sending changed properties rather than the
document. It has no targets: `SET` names a column, the map column is the whole document, and the
promoted columns are `id`, the partition keys and the system properties — every one of them either
immutable or not worth patching. So the tier is one rule-and-writer step *behind* something that
gives a document path a column of its own; see section 6. The execution ladder above it (static
decomposition via a mutation operator, the diff and blind-patch optimizations) is recorded in
`DESIGN.md` under *Updating*.

### Whole-partition `DELETE` — *built, and unverified on the path it exists for*

A predicate pinning exactly the complete partition key plans as
`DeleteAllItemsByPartitionKeyStreamAsync` — one request, no query — with a probed account
capability deciding which way the rule goes, and `COUNT(*)` first for the affected count. The
design is in `DESIGN.md` under *Deleting a whole partition*; the fallback is exercised, and the
fast path is not, because no account this repository can reach will run it.

**The gate is a support request, not a switch.** The capability is an account capability —
`az cosmosdb update --capabilities DeleteAllItemsByPartitionKey` — not a subscription preview
registration, which is what made it look portal-only the first time it was measured. Set on a fresh
account and reported back by `az cosmosdb show`, the operation still answers 400:

> Partition key delete feature is disabled for this account. Please contact Azure Support to enable
> it.

What remains, therefore, is a measurement on an account somebody has had enabled: that the fast
path fires, what it costs against the per-document loop, and one documented hazard worth confirming
— an index-using `COUNT` issued *during* an ongoing delete may still count the documents being
removed, which decides whether the reported count can be trusted. Hierarchical partition keys are
documented as unsupported, which the recovery condition already required.

### Transactional batch — *medium*

`TransactionalBatch` is atomic within a single partition key. That is a real transactional guarantee
Calcite has no way to ask for, so exposing it means a session-level or hint-level surface rather than
SQL.

### Bulk mode — *small*

`CosmosClientOptions.AllowBulkExecution` changes the throughput profile of many small writes
dramatically. A client factory can already set it; whether the adapter should is a question about who
owns the client.

---

## 4. Query language coverage

### Ranking and search

- **Spatial** — *medium.* `ST_DISTANCE`, `ST_WITHIN`, `ST_INTERSECTS`, `ST_ISVALID`. Calcite has a
  spatial operator library to map from, so the mapping is mechanical; the geometry representation and
  what a spatial index makes cheap are not.

### Subqueries

- **`EXISTS` over an item-scoped subquery** — *large.* `EXISTS (SELECT VALUE t FROM t IN c.tags WHERE …)`
  is a semi-join over a nested array. Today the only route to a nested array is `Unnest`, which
  cross-products the document with it and de-duplicates above — the wrong shape and the wrong cost for
  an existence test.
- **Scalar and multi-value subqueries** — *medium.* Item-scoped only; there are no derived tables. The
  correlated forms are what `ARRAY(SELECT …)` and `IN (SELECT …)` need.

### Scalar functions still to map

- **Temporal is what is left**, and its blocker is a declared representation rather than a
  translation — see below.
- **A host must chain a library operator table** to name `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `REVERSE` or `REPEAT` at
  all: Calcite's standard table carries none of them, and the adapter translates whatever arrives
  rather than deciding which library a caller uses. Worth a line in the README beside the
  `CosmosOperators` chaining it already documents — *small*.
- **Currently declined, admissible with work** — `SUBSTRING` without a length (`LENGTH(s)` supplies
  it); `LIKE` with `ESCAPE`, and a bracket-escaping rewrite that would lift the bracket-pattern
  decline (Cosmos `LIKE` reads `[…]` as a character range where SQL does not — measured, and why
  bracket and computed patterns are refused); `TRIM` of a non-space character and `TRUNCATE` to
  decimal places, both needing Cosmos's two-argument arity **verified** first; `IS TRUE`/`IS FALSE`/
  `IS DISTINCT FROM`, expressible with the `??` operator once the null-versus-undefined semantics are
  measured.

### Temporal — *large, and its prerequisite is a stated representation*

Cosmos has `DateTimeAdd`, `DateTimeDiff`, `DateTimePart`, `DateTimeBin` and tick conversions; Calcite
has `EXTRACT`, `TIMESTAMPADD`, `TIMESTAMPDIFF`. The mapping is mechanical and the representation is
not: a date is an ISO string or an epoch number by application convention, and `_ts` is the only value
whose encoding the service defines. Pushing a temporal function down means knowing what the column
*is*, and nothing in the row model says. `_ts` alone is reachable without answering that; everything
else waits on section 6.

### Clause-level

- **Native `IN` and `BETWEEN` — closed by measurement, not built.** `expandSearch` turns both into
  comparison chains, and the question was whether the native spelling is priced differently.
  Measured on a real account over five hundred documents: `IN` and its OR-chain cost *identically*
  at three, ten and fifty values — 6.06, 7.62 and 16.52 RU, matching to the hundredth — and
  `BETWEEN` costs exactly what its two comparisons do (7.90 RU). Neither form used an index on an
  unindexed path, so the reference's "index-friendly" is a property of the path rather than of the
  spelling. Emitting the native form would be a change with no effect.
- **`DISTINCT` with `ORDER BY` reaches promoted columns and not the map column** — *small, and what
  is left of it waits on section 6.* The null-placement rule refuses a nullable sort key, and a
  query that removes the nulls itself now satisfies it: `WHERE c.category IS NOT NULL ORDER BY
  c.category` pushes, read from `RelMdPredicates` at the rule. That covers the promoted columns.
  It does not reach a path inside the map column, and not for want of a type — such a path projects
  as `ITEM($0, 'name')` rather than as a reference, and `RelMdPredicates` carries a predicate
  through a projection only where the projection is a reference. See `DESIGN.md` under *Ordering is
  a total order over JSON types*, and section 6 below, whose case this sharpens.
- **`TOP` — closed by the same measurement.** Emitted for a rank clause and nowhere else. `TOP 10`
  and `OFFSET 0 LIMIT 10` cost the same 2.37 RU on a real account, so the spelling the adapter
  already emits is the cheaper of nothing.

---

## 5. Planner

### Nullable aggregates — *blocked on a column with a stated type*

The null-semantics refusals are the biggest source of declined aggregates: `SUM(c.v)` over a nullable
column is `undefined` at the service where SQL skips the null. The fix is rewriting the rendered
argument so Cosmos skips it too — aggregates skip *undefined*, and arithmetic on a JSON null yields
it, so `SUM(c.v * 1)` is the candidate for a column known to be numeric. The rewrite is type-directed
and cannot be applied blindly (`* 1` over a string silently drops it from `MIN`/`MAX`), and a path
inside the map column is `ANY` — so there is nothing to fire on until section 6 has an answer.
Measure on the emulator before building: that the null is skipped, that an all-null group comes back
as SQL's null does, and that `* 1` does not disturb a large integer.

### Smaller rules

- **Unique key policy** — *small.* Declared unique keys are keys `getStatistic` does not report.
- **Computed properties** — *medium.* A container can declare named, queryable, indexable computed
  paths. Declared metadata is the one kind this adapter trusts, so they should promote to real columns
  with real index awareness rather than living in the map column.

### Recorded decisions worth revisiting

- **`SELECT VALUE` for a single column** — `DESIGN.md` chose the uniform object form deliberately,
  "whatever the arity", and the materializer depends on it. A single-column projection could be bare
  scalars. Reversing a recorded decision is the work; the code is trivial.
- **`SELECT *` sends promoted columns twice** — `_MAP` is the whole document and every promoted column
  is a path within it. Reading them out of the map value client-side would avoid it; the saving is a
  few short scalars against a whole document, so smaller than it first looks.

---

## 6. Row model and types

- **A typed column over a document path — *large, and it is a question before it is work*.** Three
  items converge here and none of them can move without it: the `UPDATE` patch tier (section 3), a
  temporal basis (section 4) and the nullable-aggregate rewrite (section 5). Each needs the same
  thing — a document path the planner can see the *type* of — and the map column gives it `ANY`. A `columns` operand
  taking caller-declared paths was built for this and dropped; it is not the only shape. **Computed
  properties** (section 5) are the other candidate and a materially different one: the container
  declares them, so the adapter would be reading metadata it already trusts rather than taking a
  caller's word, and they are indexable — but the caller must create them on the container first,
  and their type still is not declared anywhere the adapter can read. Whichever way, this is a new
  public surface and wants a decision recorded in `DESIGN.md` before any code.

  **The sort key is no longer one of the four, and what it left behind reframes the other three.**
  A nullable sort key is now reachable when the query itself removes the nulls — for a promoted
  column. It is not reachable for a document path, and the obstacle turned out not to be the type
  at all: `RelMdPredicates` carries a predicate through a projection only where the projection is a
  `RexInputRef`, and a document path projects as `ITEM($0, 'name')` over the map column. So what a
  declared column buys is not only a type the planner can see but a path that projects as a
  *reference*, at which point Calcite's whole existing metadata layer — predicates, nullability,
  keys, distinctness — begins working over it with no adapter code at all. That is a larger and
  more concrete argument for the surface than "a type to work with", and it is the one worth
  putting to the decision. Measured; recorded in `DESIGN.md`.
- **Binary** — *small.* `BINARY`/`VARBINARY` read base64 from a JSON string. Unverified against the
  service, because nothing in the test data is binary.
- **Temporal representation** — see *Temporal* above. The reading side handles ISO strings and epoch
  numbers; what is missing is any declared basis for deciding which a column holds.

---

## 7. Provider and integration

- **Schema functions** — *medium, and the trade is the decision.* `CosmosOperators.Instance` is a
  `SqlOperatorTable` a caller must chain, which is why full text is unreachable from a bare
  `CalciteConnection`. Registering the functions on the schema instead means `ScalarFunctionImpl`
  over real CLR methods, and these functions cannot execute outside Cosmos, so those methods would
  throw: a non-pushed query becomes a run-time failure mid-enumeration rather than a plan-time
  refusal. That downside is measured and pinned by `CosmosFunctionResolutionTests`; there is also no
  `fun=cosmos` route, `SqlLibrary` being a closed enum.
- **Connection options as operands** — *small.* Consistency level, preferred regions, application name,
  for callers who do not want to write a factory.
- **Lazy subschemas** — *small.* Container *definitions* are read eagerly when an account-level schema
  is built, so an account with many databases pays a read per container to reach one. Statistics are
  already lazy; the definitions want a lazy `Map`.
- **Client disposal** — *small.* The schema owns a client for the life of the process because Calcite
  offers no disposal hook. Worth revisiting against `SchemaPlus` rather than left as a comment.
- **Server-side functions** — *medium.* Cosmos has stored procedures and JavaScript UDFs. A UDF is
  nameable in a query, so it could be exposed as a Calcite operator the way the built-ins are.

---

## 8. Observability

- **`CosmosDiagnostics`** — *small.* The one signal not surfaced: a large JSON blob per response, so
  it wants a switch of its own rather than to ride on the `cosmos.query` span.
- **RU regression tracking** — *medium.* The charge is on the histogram; assert that a query shape
  does not get more expensive.

---

## 9. Testing

- **A real account in CI** — *medium.* The emulator accepts statements Azure rejects and rejects
  features Azure implements; both have been found by hand. A nightly job against a real account is
  what stops the next one being found by a user — and it is where `CosmosDifferentialTests` and the
  routing measurement rerun their evidence against the real service.
- **Growing the differential corpus** — *small, forever.* The harness is done (`DESIGN.md` under
  *Differential testing*); every new pushdown should bring its statements to the corpus, and every
  translator addition is a candidate. Probed and in: filters, sorts, the aggregate forms, `LIKE`,
  and the array traversal — the guess that the oracle could not evaluate an in-process unnest was
  wrong, and the corpus says so.
- **Emulator gaps, asserted — done for the two that were wrong; keep the shape.** A skip must be
  earned by detecting the gap, never by asking which endpoint answered: the flat request charge and
  the discarded composite index were both hard-coded to `IsEmulator`, so an emulator that fixed
  either would have gone on skipping for ever. Both now measure the gap and report it, and the
  index-metrics pair already did. Any future gap belongs in that shape. *(Retained here as the rule
  rather than as a task.)*
- **A malformed response's failure mode** — *small.* A lookup-join stub returning raw documents
  instead of the statement's projection once produced a null reference inside the join's result
  selector, and which access produced it was never established. Worth knowing whether a malformed
  service response fails loudly or quietly.

---

## 10. Unsettled questions

These are not features. They are things believed but not measured, and each one is a defect waiting
for the right query.

- **Two-argument `TRIM` and `TRUNCATE`.** Left out for want of a measurement.

---

## 11. Read off Flink's connector SPI

Flink is the most complete Calcite-based connector framework in the open, and its source and sink
*ability* interfaces are a catalogue of what a pushdown-capable connector can offer. Each row below is
an interface a Flink connector implements and what it would mean for Cosmos; abilities already
covered here are not listed. Every Cosmos operation named was compile-checked against the SDK this
project references.

### Source abilities

| Flink | Here |
|---|---|
| `SupportsPartitionPushDown` | **worth taking.** Hands the planner the list of partitions. `GetFeedRangesAsync` gives the physical ones. |
| `SupportsDynamicFiltering`, `SupportsLookupCustomShuffle` | **closed by measurement** — the service's query router already prunes an `IN` over the partition key to the partitions owning the values, cross-partition execution already fans out per feed range, and per-key routing costs the per-query floor times the key count. See *The lookup restriction is already routed* in `DESIGN.md`; `CosmosLookupRoutingMeasurementTests` reruns the evidence against any real account. |
| `SupportsReadingMetadata` | **small.** Metadata columns declared rather than always promoted: `_rid`, `_self`, `_attachments`, and the per-item `ttl`. Would also let `_ts`/`_etag` stop occupying ordinary column ordinals. |
| `SupportsRowLevelModificationScan` | **worth taking.** The scan is told it is feeding an `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, so it can read only what the modification needs. Both are implemented and read whole documents to use two paths out of them — `id` and the partition key — which for a map row model is the whole cost of the statement. |
| `SupportsWatermarkPushDown`, `SupportsSourceWatermark` | **only with the change feed.** Streaming concepts; the change feed is the analogue, and `_ts` the natural watermark. See *change feed*. |

### Lookup abilities

| Flink | Here |
|---|---|
| `FullCachingLookupProvider` | **worth considering** for small containers: load the whole thing once and never call the service on a miss, with a reload strategy. A lookup table of a few thousand documents is exactly this. The partial cache — per execution and, by declared policy, across them — is done; see `DESIGN.md` under *The lookup join's caches*. |
| Lookup retry (FLIP-234) | **probably not.** Flink retries a lookup that comes back empty, for late-arriving reference data. The SDK already retries throttling, which is the failure that actually happens here. |

### Sink abilities

| Flink | Here |
|---|---|
| `SupportsTargetColumnWriting`, `SupportsRowLevelUpdate` | **Patch** — the `UPDATE` tier, waiting on a column a `SET` could target; see sections 3 and 6. |
| `SupportsDeletePushDown` | **Done, and unverifiable** — the whole-partition delete plans and is gated on a probed account capability; see section 3. |
| `SupportsTruncate` | `TRUNCATE TABLE` — per-partition deletes, or recreating the container, which is cheaper and has different semantics. Worth deciding deliberately rather than by default. |
| `SupportsOverwrite` | Upsert, which is native (`UpsertItemStreamAsync`). |
| `SupportsPartitioning` | Writes routed by partition key. Bulk mode already groups by partition, so this is mostly about telling the planner. |
| `SupportsWritingMetadata` | Writing the per-item `ttl`, which is a real Cosmos feature with no column to put it in today. |
| `SupportsStaging`, `SupportsBucketing` | **Not applicable** — two-phase commit for `CTAS` and bucketed layouts have no Cosmos counterpart; recorded so nobody looks again. |
