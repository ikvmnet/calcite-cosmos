# Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter

**Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter** lets [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) treat [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/) containers as first-class relational schemas.

Rather than going through ADO.NET or JDBC, the adapter translates the relational plan into **Cosmos SQL** — the query dialect the Cosmos DB engine natively accepts — and executes it against the container.

## How it works

1. A Cosmos database is registered with Calcite as a schema, one table per container.
2. Calcite's planner converts as much of the plan as possible into the Cosmos calling convention (`CosmosConvention`).
3. Nodes in that convention are rendered to Cosmos SQL and executed by the Cosmos query engine.
4. Results leave the convention as an `IAsyncEnumerable`, into the `ClrAsyncEnumerableConvention` provided by [`Apache.Calcite.Extensions`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Calcite.Extensions).
5. Anything Cosmos cannot express is executed in-process by Calcite, under that convention.

## Queries are asynchronous

A query over a Cosmos table plans **only** when the root is asked for in `ClrAsyncEnumerableConvention`.

This is a property of the service, not a limitation of the adapter. The Cosmos v3 SDK has no synchronous data-plane API — a page of results arrives only by awaiting `FeedIterator.ReadNextAsync` — so a synchronous plan could do nothing but block a thread for a network round trip per continuation. Rather than hide that behind an `IEnumerable`, the adapter offers only the asynchronous exit.

A container has no row schema, so a table is modelled as one map column carrying the whole document, plus promoted columns for paths the service guarantees or the container declares — `id`, `_ts`, `_etag`, and the partition key, and a `GEOGRAPHY` column for each spatially indexed path. Nothing is inferred from sampling documents.

Geography is geodesic and Calcite's own `ST_*` are planar, so the geodesic reading has a type and an `ST_GEOG_*` operator table of its own, from [`Apache.Calcite.Geography`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Calcite.Geography). A host chains that table; there is no schema route for these, unlike the full text functions.

## Install

```sh
dotnet add package Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter
```

## Register a database

```json
{
  "name": "COSMOS",
  "type": "custom",
  "factory": "Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter.CosmosSchemaFactory, Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter",
  "operand": {
    "endpoint": "https://account.documents.azure.com:443/",
    "key": "…",
    "database": "inventory",
    "containers": [ "products", "orders" ]
  }
}
```

Omit `containers` to expose every container in the database.

## Pushdown

| Operator | Rendered as |
|---|---|
| Filter | `WHERE` |
| Project | `SELECT VALUE { … }` |
| Sort | `ORDER BY`, `OFFSET`/`LIMIT` |
| Array traversal | `JOIN alias IN path` |

Relational joins, `UNION`/`INTERSECT`/`EXCEPT`, and `HAVING` have no Cosmos equivalent and are evaluated in-process by Calcite. Multi-property `ORDER BY` is pushed down only when the container declares a matching composite index, since the service rejects it otherwise.

## Full text search

Cosmos has full text search and SQL does not, so the functions come from this adapter. A Cosmos schema declares them, so a connection resolves them the way it resolves a table — name the schema as the model's `defaultSchema`, or qualify the call as `"COSMOS"."FULLTEXTCONTAINS"(…)`.

`FULLTEXTCONTAINS`, `FULLTEXTCONTAINSALL` and `FULLTEXTCONTAINSANY` are usable in a `WHERE` clause and push down to the service. The first argument must be a property path, and it must be one the container declares full text searchable — in its full text policy, in a full text index, or both — since the service refuses the query otherwise. `VECTORDISTANCE` is gated the same way, on one of its two vectors being a declared vector path.

A host that assembles its own planner rather than opening a connection chains the operator table instead, and may chain it alongside a schema without a duplicate definition:

```csharp
SqlOperatorTables.chain(SqlStdOperatorTable.instance(), CosmosOperators.Instance)
```

Ranking works when the planner is one you built. `ORDER BY FULLTEXTSCORE(c."_MAP"['name'], 'steel') FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY` becomes `ORDER BY RANK`, and `RRF(...)` fuses two scores for hybrid search. The score is never projected — the service forbids it — so it ranks the rows and does not appear in the result. Through a connection the clause is not recovered, because the projection that discards the score is applied after planning; see [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).

## What a query cost

Cosmos charges in request units and reports the charge on every response. The adapter records it, on a `Meter` and an `ActivitySource` both named `Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `cosmos.request_charge` | Request units, one measurement per response |
| `cosmos.responses` | Responses received |
| `cosmos.query` (span) | One statement, first request to last page |

Both instruments are tagged with `cosmos.container` and with `cosmos.request_kind`, which is `query` or `point_read` — so a point read can be told from the query it replaced. Collect them however you already collect .NET telemetry:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddOpenTelemetry()
    .WithMetrics(m => m.AddMeter("Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter"))
    .WithTracing(t => t.AddSource("Apache.Calcite.Cosmos.Adapter"));
```

Add `"indexMetrics": true` to the operand to have the service report which indexes each statement used; it lands on the span as `cosmos.index_metrics`. Off by default, because the service computes it per query.

## Status

Under development. Statement generation, container metadata, the schema and table layer, the scan/filter/project/sort/unnest/aggregate/rank nodes, and execution inside a Calcite plan are in place and tested. `INSERT` and `DELETE` are supported — Cosmos SQL has no DML, so a write is item CRUD over the rows a `TableModify` supplies rather than generated text; `UPDATE` is declined until it can be a patch rather than a read-modify-write. The geography operators the service evaluates — distance, within, intersects, validity and a distance bound — are translated, and are not yet rechecked in process, which the root README explains under *Geography*. What an insert writes when the map column and a promoted column describe the same document is recorded in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) under *What an insert writes*. Every emitted statement form is executed against a live service, and the suite runs against a real account when `COSMOS_TEST_ENDPOINT` and `COSMOS_TEST_KEY` name one — which the emulator is not a substitute for, it having been found to accept statements the service rejects and reject features the service implements. See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), including its record of assumptions still to be settled.
